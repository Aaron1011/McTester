While developing McTester, I've found the following bugs in other projects:

* A Gradle bug with running JUnit tests with a SecurityManager installed
* An Intellij/Kotlin bug with referencing certain packaged java classes from Kotlin
* A LaunchWrapper bug with registering transformers while classloading from another thread
* A Sponge bug with firing creeper events from the client thread
